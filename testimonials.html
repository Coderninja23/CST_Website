                      engineering at IIT Bhubaneswar, so many questions started
                      coming to my mind. Since I was about to start a new
                      journey in my life, I was worried whether I would be able
                      to get adjusted to the new environment or not. This
                      transition from home to hostel is difficult for everyone,
                      but Team CST made it smooth. From the admission process to
                      settling in hostels, my student guide, Harsh Raj bhaiya,
                      helped me a lot, and ultimately everything went well. Team
                      CST organized many events and introductions so that we
                      could get to know everything about our college.This all
                      motivated me to join CST this year.</em

                      were concerns about the new environment, the seniors, and

                      guide Niranjan Sreedhar, I felt relaxed and confident
                      about admission process. Not only during the admission
                      process, Niranjan helped me throughout the year in every
                      manner he could. The whole CST team made admission process
                      very easy and fast and I didn't face a single problem in
                      the entire process.<br /><br />

                      When I look back now, this year has been one of the best
                      times of my life. I made a lot of friends and had a great
                      time with them. The music society gave me a new family in
                      college and because of it, I was able to follow my passion
                      of music. I was inducted in the socio-cultural fest of the
                      Institute, and working in the fest was a great experience
                      for me. I got a chance to be a member of the Inter IIT
                      contingent for cult meet and it was a great experience for
                      me. I got the chance to bond with seniors.<br /><br />

                      I would like to welcome freshers to our Institute. I
                      promise you will have the time of your life here. From
                      studies to fests, you will learn to grow as an individual.
                      We at CST will try our level best to make you feel at
                      home, try to make your homesickness go away. And trust me,
                      it will. We have much in store for you, from the FGT to

                      sad to leave everyone and go far from home. Many thoughts

                      the registration process, the college, and how I will
                      adjust. My student guide Vinay Ahir helped me to deal with
                      all this. The various activities conducted by CST like
                      FGT, Treasure hunt, Heritage trips helped me get
                      acquainted with other students and was very enjoyable.<br /><br />

                      happy including me. But now the big question was which
                      branch and which college to choose. After a lot of

                      Getting into IIT Bhubaneswar was a great feeling but the

                      life inside the gates of one of the premier technical
                      institutes of India. I had doubts about the how I will

                      home without my parents and teachers, who were my pillars
                      of success. But then I got a call from my SG, Pradhan who
                      helped me clear my doubts regarding the registration
                      process, academics and the hostel life. The various events

                      The numerous societies, fests and other fun events like

                      encouraging. The atmosphere here was very positive,
                      encouraging and motivating. Now after completing one year,
                      when I look back, I can confidently say that this is the

                      desired branches in the old IITs and must choose a new

                      Then, I chose Electrical Engineering at IIT
                      Bhubaneswar.<br /><br />

                      I started asking myself many questions like, will seniors
                      help me? Will there be someone to guide me? Will I have
                      enough opportunities? Will I get adjusted to the new
                      atmosphere? These questions that were raising in my mind,
                      made me feel uncomfortable. But, this was only till I
                      received a call from my SG: Prasanjit Rath. He was very
                      friendly and cheerful. He assured me that I would enjoy my
                      stay at IIT BBS.<br />
                      As I reached the campus I was spell-bound by its greenery.
                      CST'18 members helped me in getting my registration
                      process done smoothly. They arranged many events like
                      Treasure Hunt, Heritage trips, YES+ programme, where I
                      happened to make new friends and memories. The coordinator

                      when I had problems. Academics at IIT were different from
                      academics of +1 and +2 level. It was more of self-study. I
                      had to be very patient to learn something. I faced many
                      difficulties in getting myself adjusted, and constantly
                      kept asking my SG for suggestions. He was always there to
                      help me.<br /><br />
                      Many of my friends were also very much helpful in
                      overcoming this. Being far away from parents and being
                      with friends gave me an extreme freedom. I am thankful to
                      have many seniors and friends seeing whom I could
                      constantly push myself to learn new skills, participate in
                      extra-curricular activities and explore myself, making use
                      of that freedom. <br /><br />Owing to the small community
                      we have, constant support from the professors and friends,

                      Other CST members and many other seniors too helped me in

                      hand with academics was a completely unique experience.<br /><br />"</em

                      used to enjoy my studies. So, without taking much
                      pressure, except in the last month, I studied with a happy
                      and confident mind. And after a consistent work for 2
                      years, I ultimately reached IIT Bhubaneswar.<br /><br />

                      Before coming to the campus, I got a call from my sg,
                      Prakash Zanwar. He guided me very well regarding
                      registration, accommodation, transportation etc. Thus I
                      didn't find any difficulty during the entire process of
                      registration. He handled everything in a very calm and
                      friendly manner.<br /><br />

                      As the life started at IIT BBS, the initial months were
                      quite hectic because I had never handled this much
                      responsibilities on my own, but later it was all fine. I
                      performed at FGT and got the title of Miss Diva which I
                      respect a lot as it was the first honor given to me in
                      this campus. Later, I became a member of two societies,
                      i.e, 'D-Gang' and 'Abhivyakti'. Being a part of societies
                      taught me a lot about that particular field, time
                      management and enhanced my interaction. I even
                      participated in Inter IIT Cult Meet 2018 held at IIT
                      Roorkee and food fest.<br /><br />
                      Those were my best experiences till now in this college.
                      Thus in this journey of first year, I made many friends
                      and learnt to handle good as well as bad situations on my
                      own. "</em

                      line since the day I've dreamt about having an admission
                      in India's Premier institutes like IIT. After so much of
                      patience, I finally saw the light of the day, by making it
                      to IIT BHUBANESWAR. <br /><br />My parents were on a cloud
                      nine. Obviously it is natural to have preconceptions about
                      the new environment, new culture, hostel life, and, like
                      every other person, so did I. But a call from my SG, Sayed
                      Wajahatullah eased my conceptions. The CST assisted me
                      throughout the registration process. <br /><br />In fact,
                      its one of the principle reasons for me to get accustomed
                      to the college life at IIT Bhubaneswar. The student guides
                      were so helpful in clearing the doubts regarding
                      curriculum too. Reminiscing those memories created with my
                      peers during FGT, Treasure hunt, heritage trips organised
                      by CST was such a bliss. <br /><br />Things were new when
                      I've started getting along with people from various parts
                      of India. I'm fortunate enough to have met them and
                      treasured many moments. Being a part of fest and an active
                      member of societies, I was able to discover my talents and
                      these helped me a lot to improve my skills. I'm quite
                      amused for the transition I went through as a person in
                      these 8 months, which was due to the exposure one would
                      get at IIT BBS with the right guidance of professors,
                      seniors and of course friends.<br /><br />

                      I've got to choose what I wanted to be and now I'm excited
                      to be a part of CST'19. So, Fachaas and Fachees, prepare
                      yourself to experience "The many firsts of your college
                      life". We the CST'19 is always there to help you. ALL THE

                      when I was a child. I wasn't serious regarding studies.
                      All I knew was how to play till I get fatigued and wagged
                      out, get admonished by mom for looking like a raccoon in a
                      dumpster, revel in tasty foods and pulling my sister's
                      leg. It was the same until I was 10th, for almost 15 years
                      and then things changed when I decided opt for engineering
                      as science fascinates me. I love taking up challenges and
                      hit for the best. In this way 'cracking IITJEE' came in to
                      the life of this obstreperous and irresponsible lad.<br /><br />

                      In the beginning it was all Greek to me, living on my own
                      and all. The two years after 10th were hard, emphasizing
                      with capital H. But then I found out that this temporary
                      pressure is the pathway for a permanent happiness. Though
                      it was a little late to realize I started working hard in
                      my 12th as there is no point in crying over spilt milk.
                      Though it was biting off more than I can chew, I was
                      confident and determined. Fortunately, I got in to IIT
                      Bhubaneswar.<br /><br />

                      But I was tensed regarding the registration process, until
                      my student guide Pruthvi Trinath called me. The entire CST
                      team made the registration process very efficient. This
                      transition period would not have been so smooth without
                      the CST team. They organized events like the FGT, treasure
                      hunt which helped me to make friends and get adjusted to
                      the environment.<br /><br />

                      Looking back, last year might be one of the most memorable
                      year of my life. Being a member of the hostel council, an
                      active member of societies, participating in the 53rd
                      inter IIT sports meet; all these experiences enhanced my
                      skills. Above all I found amazing people here who now are
                      like a family to me.<br /><br />"</em

                      rides. Every ride is a new environment providing brand new
                      experiences, all of which together makes life beautiful.
                      The most difficult parts in the complete journey are the
                      'transitions' from one ride to another.<br /><br />

                      Taking admission into IIT BBS was one such for me in my
                      life. Entering a world entirely different from my previous
                      one left me with a bag of mixed emotions. Hope of starting
                      a new life, confusion; excitement, fear; joy of joining an
                      IIT, a heavy heart; all together put me in a complexly
                      confused state. It was during this time Rahul Naidu stood
                      by me and many of my friends. He was an epitome of
                      strength for us. Nothing could have comforted us more than
                      his words. He was truly our student 'guide'.<br /><br />

                      A good start further ensured I had a great stay throughout
                      the year. Learning was an integral process that involved
                      committing mistakes, correcting, and a loop again. The
                      beauty is every mistake taught me a valuable lesson which
                      I now would like to concentrate upon and improve further.
                      I hope to keep learning and enjoy the process. Being a
                      part of CST now, if my experience will be of help to
                      anyone coming, I would be more than happy to lend my

                      at one go, happiness, excitement, nervousness,

                      toughest entrance exam considered all over the world.
                      There was a sense of peace and yet I could feel little
                      pressure in my mind. And then, it began. The time duration
                      of six hours zoomed past before me and it felt as if only
                      two to three hours had passed. Never in my life, I had
                      felt the importance of each second. At last it was over, a
                      sense of joy, relaxation and memories of last two years

                      a seat at IIT Bhubaneswar; I felt relaxed. My family and
                      myself were thrilled as the hard work had paid off but
                      also felt sad as I was supposed to stay away from my

                      a single day away from my parents.<br /><br />

                      of other students in the country to study to enter an IIT.
                      From that point for the next two years entering an IIT was
                      my only goal. Finally, in 2018 I entered IIT
                      Bhubaneswar.<br /><br />

                      I was excited to come here but nervous to witness a
                      complete new phase in my life; this is the point where our
                      student guides play a very important role. My student
                      guide, Rahul Abburu Naidu guided me so well I didn't face
                      much difficulties getting used to this huge campus and its
                      student environment.<br /><br />

                      At first, the college environment was very new to me, but
                      because I studied 11th and 12th grades in a hostel, it was
                      not a difficult task to adjust here. Even the YES+ program
                      held before the commencement of our classes helped us get
                      to know each other and increase our friendship radar in
                      the college. Even senior-junior relationship in college is
                      better than other colleges, we are proud to say it is a
                      complete ragging free campus.<br /><br />

                      Now when I look back after a full year of experience, I
                      learnt a lot about time management, and enhanced a ton of
                      skills I had taken from 11th and 12th grades.<br /><br />

                      Being a part of the Hostel Management team, as councilor
                      it was a great experience. As this is a new generation
                      IIT, the best part is that you get to see a lot of
                      opportunities unfold unlike other old IITs. Even the
                      various cultural and technical societies in the college
                      help a student prosper in various other fields other than
                      studies. Faculty members are experienced and student
                      friendly. "</em

                      worked hard after my 10th grade examinations. I studied my
                      plus one and two in one of the top coaching centers of
                      India and after two years of hard work I was into IIT

                      I froze my options in the first round of JOSAA
                      Counselling, and after a few days, my senior guide,

                      Life in an IIT is totally different, I was not new to
                      hostel life, but I was new to IIT life. I explored many
                      things, fests and societies occupied a special place in my
                      heart, friends and seniors played a major role in the past
                      one year of my life. Seniors helped me a lot here, and I
                      want to thank all of them. Night-outs, birthdays are the
                      most memorable days here.<br /><br />

                      happy to be blessed with the tag IITian by making it to
                      IIT BHUBANESWAR. My parents too were very happy for me,

                      surprised when I received a call from my SG,Sudiptha

                      transition to college life smooth. Working in fests,
                      societies, midnight parties, keeping discussions on some

                      various celebrations, hostel games are some of
                      unforgettable memories I ever had. I was nervous about the
                      academics here when compared to old IITs. But the
                      professors here are supportive, encouraging and there are
                      enough facilities for research activities.<br /><br />

                      juniors. All the activities which took place made me learn

                      entrepreneurship and innovative activities are strongly
                      supported. Best part of college life is the bond you make

                      through life without any ultimate goal or purpose. Then
                      came 11th and 12th, and everyone around me started
                      preparing for JEE. Initially, I was only preparing so that
                      I could fit in better with my friends, but soon, for
                      reasons that I still do not know, I started preparing
                      seriously. As the exam neared, I felt frightened, scared
                      even and for some while, I was unable to study. My friends
                      and my family brought me back from that dark space, and
                      soon, I was back in the game.<br /><br />

                      The day of JEE came and went, and soon, the results were
                      out. I found out that I had gotten a seat in IIT
                      Bhubaneswar. I was elated. My preparations had finally
                      paid off. My preparations to go and live in another state
                      started. I began to fret, I became tensed at the thought
                      of living away from my parents, I a state that I had never
                      before been to. Soon, my student guide, Prasanjit Rath
                      contacted me, and informed me of all the requirements. He
                      clarified all my doubts, was and was patient with me while
                      doing so. After his call, I felt relaxed, for I felt that
                      I had found a friend in the campus, and someone to look up
                      to.<br /><br />

                      Soon, I arrived at the campus, and was immediately
                      mesmerised by it's scenic beauty. I was enthralled at the
                      possibility of studying at an prestigeous institute like
                      IIT Bhubaneswar. My registration process went without an
                      hiccup, thanks to the CST18 team. The events organised by
                      them helped me settle into the campus without any
                      problems. Seeing their teamwork and coordination, I was
                      heavily inspired. A part of me aspired to be a part of
                      something greater, and when the applications for CST19
                      rolled in, I just knew that I had to apply.<br /><br />

                      Over the course of the year, I have been a part of
                      societies, fests, all of which have provided me with
                      invaluable experiences, friends, and have given me a sense
                      of direction, purpose for the next 3 years. My first year
                      of college has been a blast, and has been one of the best
                      years of my life so far. I hope that this institute, which
                      has provided me with a marvelous first year, will provide
                      you, our juniors, with the same."</em

                      wasn't really into studies. Then my sister motivated me to
                      get admission into one of the most prestigious institute
                      of India i.e, IIT . With all my determination and hard
                      work I finally made it into IIT Bhubaneswar.<br /><br />

                      When I first came to Bhubaneswar I was very excited but
                      quite anxious as well, because I had many doubts regarding
                      our college but my Student Guide, Ms. Rama Pratyusha, was
                      really sweet and helpful. She shared her valuable
                      experiences with me which I found really helpful. I didn't
                      face any problems through out the registration process as
                      all the details shared by my SG and CST'18 were completely
                      elaborative.<br /><br />

                      Climate in Bhubaneswar is quite different from
                      Maharashtra, but I adjusted pretty quickly because of the
                      wonderful people I met after joining the institute.
                      Everyone in college is very encouraging and supportive. I
                      made friends that now are like family to me.<br /><br />

                      interacted with a lot of people and also learnt many
                      things from them. I also participated in Inter IIT
                      cultural Meet held at IIT Roorkee and food fest which made
                      my first year even more memorable.<br /><br />"</em

                      an IIT and after the JEE advanced results I was filled
                      with enthusiasm, happiness and later, fear and confusion.
                      After the JoSAA seat allotment I had many questions in my
                      mind regarding the registration process and life at IIT
                      Bhubaneswar. <br /><br />Since my childhood I was always
                      worried about my certificates and I always had a fear of
                      misplacing them during the registration but then came a
                      call from my student guide RAHUL PENDYALA who was very
                      helpful and kind. He answered every silly question of mine
                      without any kind of hesitation. He erased the fear of
                      registration from my mind by giving a complete brief about
                      it. He was the one who made me realise that life at IIT is
                      not just about studies but a platform to explore
                      ourselves.<br /><br />

                      Soon I started exploring myself and when I look back a
                      year I visualise the beautiful memories which I made with
                      my friends and the campus. The programs conducted by the
                      CST team played an important role in shaping my character
                      from an introvert to an extrovert. And then I started
                      taking part in fests and societies. The societies and
                      fests made me realise the importance of team work and
                      leadership which created a huge impact on my character.<br /><br />

                      anxious, excited and worried, I was out of my mind. At
                      that time I received a call from my SG Nikitha who helped
                      me to hold my nerve, with the help of her and CST team the
                      registration process went on smoothly. Hailing from a
                      different place and adjusting to the college environment
                      brings its own challenges. <br /><br />However, at IIT
                      Bhubaneswar, you would quickly adapt to surroundings here,
                      the climate is a bit unpredictable but it is excellent.
                      You can really take a breath of fresh air and find
                      yourself a lot closer to nature. CST organised FGT,
                      treasure hunt, heritage trips which helped to find new
                      friends who made my life more memorable. I loved every
                      minute of my first year. Late night cricket, movies,
                      matches, societies, fests which made to push to my limits

                      >"After high school it was my dream to study along with
                      the smartest brains of the nation. Well, obviously, IIT's
                      are one of, if not, the best our country has to offer. And
                      only the best out of the best are entitled to be in one.
                      <br />
                      And so I started preparing for JEE. Being one of the
                      toughest exams, it was thrilling yet a gruesome journey. I
                      still remember the trepidation before the exam, I can
                      imagine myself in the Hall even now. I couldn't stop
                      reminiscing about it until the results came out.<br /><br />

                      When I found out, that I made it, I was thrilled beyond
                      measure. It must have been because of the months of
                      intimidating nights, giga bytes worth of cramming
                      inorganic and the vicious journey that was endured. To
                      finally succeed was a big relief. <br /><br />

                      That aside, the subsequential research that went into
                      filling JoSAA forms and registration process was not
                      pleasant to the slightest degree, somehow I managed
                      through it and the final round told me "you're going to
                      Bhubaneswar, son", which is pretty far from where I live.
                      And the registration was like, just 3-4 days after the
                      final round.. Obviously I was anxious and restless, so
                      were my parents.<br /><br />

                      And all that while I never knew there was a team, working
                      behind the scenes, doing all that they can to ensure, we
                      freshers don't feel overwhelmed. <br />
                      It would be unjust of me not to mention my student guide,
                      Prakash Zanwar and of course the entire CST '18 team who
                      transformed the seemingly gruelling process to a cake
                      walk. I thank them for their combined efforts to help me
                      kick start my 5 year quest for knowledge with ease. <br />
                      Well what happened after is history, only to become, and
                      live, as memories. From the heritage trips to the treasure
                      hunt, everything was panned out so fittingly. With fests
                      and societies and a ton of smart people to meet and make
                      friends with college turned out to be a lot more fun. It
                      was arguably the best year of my life, except ofcourse for
                      the unprecedented weather changes."

                      me hard. I was about to travel far away from my family to
                      an unknown place, meet new people and stay with them for
                      years. The joy of cracking IIT was short-lived when I
                      realized the anxiety I was about to face. I desperately
                      needed a guide, a mentor, and above all, a friend. Amidst
                      all this confusion, I got a call from my Student Guide,
                      Sai Prasanth. Just like Arya Stark had come out of nowhere
                      to kill the Night King, that single 'out of the blue'
                      phone call cleared my anxiety. To be honest, the first few
                      months were the smoothest, thanks to him. The CST'18 had
                      done an amazing job. Right from registration to
                      transportation on my first day of the first year to my
                      studies on the last day of my first year, the SG's were
                      there for me.<br /><br />

                      From being shy to boldly approaching strangers, IIT had a
                      knack of bringing me to its track. The heritage trips, the
                      society and the fest I've been inducted into, turned out
                      to be unarguably the full time 'fun-givers' to my IIT
                      life. The journey in the past year was quite an
                      experience. This multi-cultured campus is truly a blessing
                      to any student's life. Self-learning is the most important
                      tool this college has given me. Let it be studies or
                      outdoor activities; this tool will come in handy.<br /><br />

                      So to all the freshers, "Cheers!". You are about to enter
                      a brand new phase in your life. We the CST are here for
                      you. We can't guarantee that your journey here would be
                      easy, but it surely will be fun-filled. All the best for
                      everything ahead."</em

                      options list in JoSAA site was even harder and the rounds
                      were similar to that of boxing rounds . At last I ended up
                      in IIT Bhubaneswar, I didn't know anyone from IIT
                      Bhubaneswar, all I prayed was for a mentor. My prayers
                      were answered, thanks to Harsha Vardhan my student guide
                      who helped me from the start of my college life up until
                      now. He was very patient and helpful, answered every
                      stupid question that I asked without hesitation. This one
                      year in this scenic campus was the best in my life.
                      Meeting new people and making new friends and completing

                      treasure hunt that were organised by CST'18 were very
                      interactive and engaging. I have learnt to interact with
                      different people and improved a lot in managing my 'time'
                      which is the most important tool to build a good career. I

                      The thing I was most afraid of the same happened, results
                      were not as I had expected. It took a week to recollect
                      myself and accept reality. Reality is majorly hard to
                      accept as they are not always sweet. However, I motivated
                      myself and told myself that everything happens for some
                      reason. The reason that is always for good.<br /><br />

                      But I never overlooked mistakes or faults that had
                      happened.Leaving everything behind, my new chapter at IIT
                      Bhubaneswar started after counselling. As I reached the

                      now I was out the race so-called JEE. Although I was
                      alotted an SG(student guide Ritika Gujrati ), I was
                      alotted to another SGs in her absence, Aditya and
                      Harshvardhan. They helped me out. They were so good at
                      guiding and helping us in every way. It was all a sweet
                      memory with all SG's at FGT and they were first whom we
                      know at IIT at this new place. I hope I'll be a good SG as

                      its own lows and highs, but it was definitely self-belief
                      and hard work combined that got me into IIT BBS.<br /><br />

                      I still recall how hectic those days of college

                      Informing me about all the necessities and taking care of
                      all my doubts, even the silly ones, which I think all of

                      when I enrolled. When I look back, I realize the
                      transformation I have gone through. Taking part in a lot
                      of activities throughout the year, be it food fest, hostel
                      games, Wissenaire, going for daily badminton practice
                      helped me to stay busy, have fun and added many soft
                      skills to my skill set.<br /><br />

                      I feel the overall course in the college is structured in
                      a way that allows students to learn and grow in a
                      supportive environment, and I think it gives everyone the
                      opportunity to thrive. Through the help and guidance of my
                      seniors, I could rediscover myself and follow my passion
                      for sports again, and not to forget all the weekend trips
                      we had together, the late night birthday bashes have made
                      some unforgettable memories. It is a dream come true to be
                      a part of this institution.<br /><br />

                      So, let's take this path together, learn together and have
                      fun together and I would be more than happy to welcome all

                      graduate, elaborated on his college culture (timings,
                      student bodies and events). Everything about it was very
                      fascinating. He said, and I quote, "IIT's are the best
                      platforms to explore anything because of their culture,
                      system and the opportunities they offer". His talks
                      motivated me. When I got to know that two-and-a-half days
                      are off in a week and four months of holidays in the
                      college calendar, my zeal to study in an IIT went even
                      higher.<br /><br />

                      At first I was tense about the registration process, for
                      they were lengthy and complex. I had many doubts about the
                      process and wanted to talk to a college student directly.
                      Thanks to CST'18, I got a call from Sai Prasath, my
                      student guide, that call cleared all my doubts and I felt
                      relaxed. He was patient and cool and answered all my silly
                      doubts. He gave me all the information beforehand, making
                      it easy and helped me when in need, thanks to him my
                      registration process went without a hiccup. "Student
                      guides are your relatives in an alien place," so make good
                      use of their presence.<br /><br />

                      The events organised by CST'18 FGT, Treasure Hunt, and
                      Heritage Trips were really amazing. You'll interact with
                      many people and make friends, fests and societies were the
                      best part of IIT and my first year. More societies you
                      join, the more friends you'll make, and more the
                      adventures you get to do. The three days of Wissenaire
                      were my best days. TIME, SLEEP AND WEATHER are the three
