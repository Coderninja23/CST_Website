                    <h4>Our Goals</h4>

                    <p>The Counselling Service Team (or CST as we like to call it), at IIT Bhubaneswar, is a student body consisting of students 
                        driven with a passion to help others, guided by their mentors from the teaching staff. Established to serve and cater to the 
                        problems of the freshmen of IIT Bhubaneswar, the CST has always been helping and offering a comfort zone to express oneself 
                        freely. Counselling for us, is a process that develops a bond among the freshers and their seniors, creating a mentor-student 
                        relationship. We intend to cultivate in a student, an insight and develop him into a confident individual who may get through 
                        the inner turmoil and outer perils whenever the time calls upon.</p>

                    <p>After multiple years of coaching and toiling to get into an IIT, students find themselves facing the responsibility of dealing 
                        with what ought to be done in their newly acquired independence, while moving into their new home. This difficulty is eased 
                        out as the students are in constant supervision of their Student Guides from CST right from the time they get enrolled in 
                        IIT-BBS. The CST is responsible for introducing freshers to their new environment away from their beloved parents which is 
                        mostly a first time for a majority of them.</p>

                    <h4>Our Work</h4>
                    <p>We ensure all round development of a student's personality and confidence and see to it that he/she may get to become an 
                        individual with skills and tools to cut through even the most difficult situations in college life and beyond. We introduce
                        them to the platforms which helps them to hone their skills and talents. We cater to their needs and provide them with a 
                        detailed know-how of our college.</p>

                    <p>In our counseling service team, our work revolves around guiding paths and illuminating lives. We are deeply committed to 
                        assisting individuals in finding their way through the challenges they face, and we take great pride in helping them 
                        discover new perspectives, regain their inner strength, and ultimately achieve personal growth and fulfillment.</p>

                    <p>CST through its activities and events aims to create a safe haven for students who are now exposed to the highly competitive 
                        and everchanging landscape. We aim to facilitate and support the mental physical and social growth of the students. We strive 
                        to cushion the turbulent journey of transitioning to a new environment making it as smooth as possible</p>

                    <h4>Our Passion</h4>

                    <p>Passion is the driving force behind our work. It is what compels us to show up every day, ready to lend an empathetic ear, 
                        a non-judgmental presence, and a compassionate heart. We understand that life can be challenging, and each person's 
                        struggles are unique. Our team is here to provide a safe space where individuals can freely express their thoughts, 
                        emotions, and fears without fear of being misunderstood.</p>


                    <p>So parents, be confident that your child will get constant guidance from our members and all of his/her questions will be 
                        answered, for we are here to help! Do ask us anything and everything, and get rid of that last shred of worry eating you 
                        up at the back of your mind. We, at CST are here to make sure that the students get the best atmosphere to develop and 
                        shine, for he/she is in the very path to be part of the legacy that has produced excellent engineers, business tycoons, 
                        civil servants, revolutionary politicians (lately) and what not.</p>
